# SSH_deployment

## Overview

This application is meant to keep two directory trees on two different computers or servers synced. This can be used when developing remotely.

## Idea

I decided to make this project after my license to Pycharm Professional was about to expire. I did not want to pay for it and was sad about losing this feature that Pycharm provides.

## Use

I used this project often during my classes. Professors would give students access to a unix timeshare machine on campus which we could ssh into. This project let me still develop on local files in any IDE I wanted to as I knew that the project I was devloping was simply getting copied over to the timeshare.
